Claim: this course is designed based on [UCSD CSE 291](https://patpannuto.com/classes/2021/spring/cse291/) by Prof. Pat Pannuto.  

## Overview

IoT represents a paradigm shift in computing, aiming to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Its development has opened up new possibilities, including mobile health, smart homes, industrial automation, and more. Throughout the course, students will delve into advanced topics such as IoT networking, mobile and edge computing, embedded machine learning, wireless sensing, human-computer interaction, and mobile health applications. To excel in this course, students are expected to engage in pre-class readings, active in-class participation, and complete a semester-long project. The focus of the course will be on training research philosophy and principle instead of paper’s technical detail. 


## Target Audience

The intended audience of this course is PhD students or masters students who are interested in pursuing a PhD in the future. This is a research-oriented class. It's designed to bring people up to speed on the history as well as the state of the art in mobile computing and to gain experience with the design, early implementation, and evaluation of a research idea. The course covers multiple disciplines and encourage interdisciplinary project, students with diverse backgrounds such as computer science/engineering, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering or other related areas are welcomed.


## Syllabus

This class is made of three co-equal components: pre-class reviews, in-class participation, and a quarter-long project.

### Paper reviews

Before each class you must read each paper and then write a short review. This should be more than a simple summary of the paper. Here are some questions to consider while reading and writing your reviews to help guide you:

What is the problem this paper addresses, and why is it important?
What is the hypothesis of this paper?
How was this hypothesis evaluated? What supported it, what refuted it?
What are the limits of this system (when does it fail)?
What is this most similar to that you are already familiar with; how does it compare, differ?
At what point did you decide you liked – or didn't like – the paper, why?
