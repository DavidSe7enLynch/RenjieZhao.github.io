I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate at [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) Department in [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), advised by Professor [Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu). My research interest lies in mobile computing and wireless networking.

I received my B.S degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2018, where I worked on Backscatter Communications with Professor [Xiaohua Tian](http://iiot.sjtu.edu.cn/xtian/) and Professor [Xinbing Wang](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/).
